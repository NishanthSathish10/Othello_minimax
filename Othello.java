/**
 * Othello.java
 * A board game, with the following rules.
 * Two black and two white pieces are placed in the middle of the 8 x 8 board 
 * in the form of a square. W and B are placed on the top middle row, and then B, W 
 * is placed on the row below it.  Black plays first and places its piece on a 
 * valid spot on the grid. You must place a disc on a spot that allows you to "flank" 
 * or "capture" at least one of your opponent's discs by bordering them "in a row".
 * You must flip all captured discs to your color.  To capture your opponent's discs
 * you must have 1 of your own pieces at the end of a row and then on your turn place
 * a new piece at the beginning of the row. Everything in between on that row is now 
 * flipped to your color. You can only capture rows of a single color adjacent to each 
 * other; there cannot be any open space or your own discs between them or the combo is 
 * interrupted.  You can flank any number of discs. You may capture discs vertically, 
 * horizontally, diagonally.  You may capture in multiple directions at the same time. 
 * All discs that can be flipped must be flipped. You cannot pick and choose which ones 
 * are captured.  If you cannot make a valid move then your turn is forfeit and your 
 * opponent may go again. If you have a valid move available to you then you must make 
 * that move and are not allowed to forfeit your turn.  When neither player can make 
 * any further play then the game is over.  Each player counts the number of spaces 
 * occupied by their color. Highest count is the winner. Games can end before all 
 * spaces are filled.
